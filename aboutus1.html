            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Lakeland Reeds is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin Lakes watching the sunset over the cattails, or just curled up in a hammock on our wraparound porch with a good book.  Breakfast is ready whenever you are, and we&rsquo;re happy to accommodate a wide range of appetites, from comfort food, like sausage and biscuits, to the lighter end of things, such as egg white omelettes and fresh fruit.</p>
            <p>We&rsquo;re here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to popcorn and a DVD of The Wizard of Oz for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you!</p>
